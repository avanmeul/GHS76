        <p>This is the webpage for 
            <a href="https://golden.jeffcopublicschools.org/" target="_blank">Golden High School (GHS)</a> 
            class of 1976 (GHS '76) in

                    Left:  What GHS currently looks like.  
                    The buildings that existed during the GHS '76 years were removed, and an entirely new campus was created.
                    Life goes on....
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    The improvements would make even a Demon (pun alert!) turn green with envy!
                    (Demons are the mascott of GHS.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    GHS now has a "Mountain Bike Engineering" class.  (In our day, we didn't even have mountain bikes!  =:0)
                </p>

                <p>Some classmates lived in a region that were supposed to go to Wheat Ridge High School, 
                    but requested special permission to attend Golden High School instead.</p>

        <h2>Alumni Directory</h2>

        <p>We have a Google Shared drive with resources for our class, including the definitive spreadsheet of all known classmates.
        </p>
        <p>
            The spreadsheet drew from the 1976 Yearbook, the 1998 Golden High School Alumni Directory, the 40th reunion RSVP list on 
            Classmates.com, and includes current information given to us by classmates (including who is deceased).</p>
        </p>
        <p>If you would like access to this spreadsheet, please send André (or one of the other contacts) an email, and we'll add your email address to the access list for this share.  The spreadsheet is password protected; and the password will be given to you when access is granted.</p>

        <h2>The 50 year reunion</h2>

        <p>The following (slightly edited) information was posted on Classmates.com [ <a href="https://www.classmates.com/reunions/Golden-High-School/class-of-1976/2642508" target="_blank">https://www.classmates.com/reunions/Golden-High-School/class-of-1976/2642508</a> ].  
            A free account on Classmates.com will enable you to RSVP to the 50 year reunion tracking system on that system.
        </p>

        <p><b>Please note:  if you do not have an account on Classmates.com, clicking on the aforementioned link will probably fail for you.</b>
            You must also be signed in to Classmates.com, or use a browser that knows your Classmates.com credentials.</p>

        <p>A group of us are planning a 50 year reunion on August 28 (Friday) and 29 (Saturday), 2026.</p>

        <p>We are reaching out via this website (hosted via André's GitHub account) [ <a href="https://avanmeul.github.io/GHS76" target="_blank">https://avanmeul.github.io/GHS76</a> ], Classmates.com, the GHS alumni reunion webpage [ <a href="https://www.goldenhighalumni.org/reunions">https://www.goldenhighalumni.org/reunions</a> ], and the GHS alumni Facebook webpage in order to gather information from our classmates and get an idea on how many would be attending this reunion.  Once we have an idea of how many would be attending we can formalize the details; but we are estimating the cost per person to be around $50.00 for a dinner on Saturday night.</p>

        <p>We will also offer some free events; for example a GHS courtyard meeting before the dinner.  This will offer a tour of the new GHS campus and possibly a slide show of memories (to be held in the GHS cafeteria).</p>

        <p>We are also looking into a (free) meet (and get reacquainted) event on Friday evening (possibly with a cash bar).</p> 

        <p>If you would be interested in attending any of the reunion events, please let Debbie Dalton (or one of the organizers) know.  We are hoping for a good turnout on the big 50!</p>

        <p>Please RSVP, even if you only plan to attend the free events, and even if you aren't planning on attending.  (We'd love to hear from everyone to see how you're doing! =:0)</p>

        <p>Below are classmates that have RSVPed.</p>

        <p>So far, we have 19 yes responses, 10 guests, and 4 maybes; making a total of 29 attendees (possibly 33).</p>
