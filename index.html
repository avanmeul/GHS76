        <h2>The 50 year reunion</h2>

        <p>The following (slightly edited) information was posted on Classmates.com [ <a href="https://www.classmates.com/reunions/Golden-High-School/class-of-1976/2642508" target="_blank">https://www.classmates.com/reunions/Golden-High-School/class-of-1976/2642508</a> ].  A free account on Classmates.com will enable you to RSVP to the 50 year reunion tracking system on that system.</p>

        <p>A group of us are planning a 50 year reunion on August 28 (Friday) and 29 (Saturday), 2026.</p>

        <p>We are reaching out via this website (hosted via André's GitHub account) [ <a href="https://avanmeul.github.io/GHS76" target="_blank">https://avanmeul.github.io/GHS76</a> ], Classmates.com, the GHS alumni reunion webpage [ <a href="https://www.goldenhighalumni.org/reunions">https://www.goldenhighalumni.org/reunions</a> ], and the GHS alumni Facebook webpage in order to gather information from our classmates and get an idea on how many would be attending this reunion.  Once we have an idea of how many would be attending we can formalize the details; but we are estimating the cost per person to be around $50.00 for a dinner on Saturday night.</p>

        <p>We will also offer some free events; for example a GHS courtyard meeting before the dinner.  This will offer a tour of the new GHS campus and possibly a slide show of memories (to be held in the GHS cafeteria).</p>

        <p>We are also looking into a (free) meet (and get reacquainted) event on Friday evening (possibly with a cash bar).</p> 

        <p>If you would be interested in attending any of the reunion events, please let Debbie Dalton (or one of the organizers) know.  We are hoping for a good turnout on the big 50!</p>

        <p>Please RSVP, even if you only plan to attend the free events, and even if you aren't planning on attending.  (We'd love to hear from everyone to see how you're doing! =:0)</p>
